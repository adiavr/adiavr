👋 Hi, I’m Adriana

    👀 I’m interested in software development and cloud technologies.
    🌱 I’m currently learning Python, FastAPI, Django, SQL, Docker, and AWS.
    🤝 I’m passionate about backend development, building clean APIs, and scaling systems that just work.
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects, open-source contributions, and innovative software development.
